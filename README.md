# **DeFi Protocol Project**

### **Overview**
This repository contains the source code for a DeFi protocol built as part of the **Advanced Foundry Course by Cyfrin Updraft**. The protocol incorporates essential decentralized finance functionalities, providing a foundational understanding of smart contract development and Web3 concepts.

### **Features**
- **Built with Security Best Practices**
- **Scalable Architecture**

### **Tech Stack**
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Language**: Solidity
- **Development Framework**: Foundry
- **Tools Used**: [e.g., Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Ethers.js]

### **How to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   cd [repository-name]

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   forge install

3. ***Run Tests:***
   ```bash
   forge test

4. ***Deploy to a Test Network:***
 - **Configure your `.env` file with the required environment variables (e.g., private key, RPC URL).**
 - **Deploy the contracts:** ` forge script deploy --rpc-url <network-url> --private-key <your-private-key>`


### **Project Highlights**
- **Smart Contract Security:** Implemented industry best practices to ensure protocol safety.
- **Gas Optimization:** Efficiently structured the code for minimal transaction costs.
- **Learnings:** This project enhanced my understanding of DeFi mechanisms and smart contract development using Foundry.
